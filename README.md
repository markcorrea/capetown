Project Overview:

TS Agenda is a simple project with the only purporse of learning/practicing Typescript (from here the 'TS' in the name).
It is composed by two blocks set aside each other with a calendar on the top and the compromises being listed under these calendars. The positioning of these blocks is made based on an open notebook (simulating two pages). 

This project uses no backend. The data is just a mock created in a JSON object. So, if the page is refreshed, all data will be lost. But you an of course not update the page, and add the compromises and test as you wish.

## Project Installation:

This project is installed using Node's Package Manager (NPM). If you don't have it on your machine yet, you can download it here: https://nodejs.org/en/;

To do so, you have to use Linux or MAC's Terminal. If you are using Windows, the command prompt won't work. I recommend downloading Git Bash.

This project contains a package.json file, which means that the necessary libraries will be installed once you type the specified command. Being so, please go to the Terminal and access the root file of your project. Once done, run "npm install".

All libraries will be installed inside the node_modules folder.

Once done, go to the terminal again and run "npm start".

Webpack will start the server and , once done, you can access it by http://localhost:8080.
